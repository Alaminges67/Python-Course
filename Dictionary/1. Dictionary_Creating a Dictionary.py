# Example 1: Creating a Dictionary
# A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, created using curly braces {}.
# Each key is unique, and it is used to access its corresponding value.

# Creating a dictionary with various key-value pairs
my_dict = {'student_name': 'Al_Amin', 'age': 24, 'roll': 102}

# Printing the created dictionary
print('A student information:', my_dict)
